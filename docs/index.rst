Welcome to exomagpy's documentation!
==================================

**exomagpy** is a Python package that uses machine learning to find exoplanet candidates.
 It takes lightcurves from user-input datasets from the `NASA Exoplanet Archives <https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/>`_
and puts them through a binary classification neural network, making the task of searching for
exoplanet candidates in fresh data *quick* and *easy*.

   This project is under active development.
